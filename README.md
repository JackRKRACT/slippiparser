# Slippi Parser

Replay parsing tool built in NodeJS for the game Super Smash Brothers Melee. Converts and catalogs large replay files into lightweight .csv format.

I put this together to gain a better understanding of NodeJS & to be able to digest and produce statistics on my own Slippi data with relative ease. Upon launch, it will prompt the user for their Slippi replay directory & the output file name. It will then parse all .slp files in target folder and output a corresponding CSV.
